# Game Square

This is a tech demo of how a game square can be implemented for a game like Ludo where up to four pieces of up to four colors could land up on the same square.

* With one colored piece, the piece should be shown front and center in the game square.
* With two or more colored pieces of the same color, the piece should have a count in the center.
* With two pieces of different colors, the colors should stay separate and show, if needed, the count of each color.
